+++

In last week, I have been working on integrating GooglePageSpeed Insights v2 api and [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/) with site_audit.

Google PageSpeed Ingihts measures how the page can improve its performance on:

* time to above-the-fold load: Elapsed time from the moment a user requests a new page and to the moment the above-the-fold content is rendered by the browser.
* time to full page load: Elapsed time from the moment a user requests a new page to the moment the page is fully rendered by the browser.

I then generates actionable reports based on the above tests on how to make the webaite load faster. PageSpeed Insights gives recommanedation for both - for mobile and desktop devices. An API key is needed to run the PageSpeed Insights test. Follow the instructions given [here](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/oauth) to obtain an API key.

Here is a sample report I generated for [https://drupal.org](https://drupal.org) using site_audit

          Enable compression: (low impact: 0.5096)
            Compressing resources with gzip or deflate can reduce the number of bytes sent over the network.
            Enable compression for the following resources to reduce their transfer size by https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/EnableCompression (4.6KiB reduction).
              Compressing https://www.drupal.org/sites/all/modules/drupalorg/drupalorg/images/d8.svg could save 2.8KiB (60% reduction).
              Compressing https://www.drupal.org/sites/all/themes/bluecheese/images/community-users.svg could save 1.1KiB (51% reduction).

          Leverage browser caching: (low impact: 2.483630952381)
            Setting an expiry date or a maximum age in the HTTP headers for static resources instructs the browser to load previously downloaded resources from local disk rather than over the network.
            Leverage browser caching for the following cacheable resources:
