I am Shivanshu, a 5th year B.Tech M.Tech Dual Degree student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I will graduate in summer 2016. I feel a little uncomfortable talking about myself but since you have visited this page, I feel obliged to write more.

I am the type of being that conforms to [The Hacker Attitude](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) and try to utilize my time in solving some fascinating problem through technology but I am yet to complete my [1000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) to master the craft. I am particularly interested in web technologies and I also contribute a little to open-source.

I try to read as much as I can but despite my efforts, I realize that I am not able to read more than about 15 books in an year. I read all kinds of books but of all the genre, I like the classics the most. I also like to watch lots of movies/tv-series/anime in my free time. Sometimes I binge-watch an entire tv-series or anime.

### Blog Name?
 Why `ninjaduck`?  
 It is an offbeat unconventional name and sounds cool.
