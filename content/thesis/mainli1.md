supervisors, Prof. Mainak Chaudhuri and Prof. Sumit Ganguly for their guidance,
constant support and encouragement. This thesis would not have been possible without
them.
<p>I thank the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur for providing
the necessary infrastructure and congenial environment facilitating this research
work.

<p>   I also thank Tejas Gandhi for providing invaluable help in setting up Openstack,
Adarsh Jagannath for various useful discussions we had which proved instrumental in the
progress of this thesis, Abhimanyu Arora for working on a part of this thesis together
with me, and all my fellow batchmates for the delightful time we spent together and
making my stay at IITK memorable.
