I have been a linux user for more than two years now and the search for a perfect desktop environment is still on. I have tried many of the popular ones - Unity, Gnome 2 and 3, KDE, Cinnamon and MATE. Each of them have a different philosophy which is suitable for some type of users but all of them are either very heavy-weight or have a some very frustrating bugs. So, I decided to try a new window manager instead of a Desktop Environment and switched to [i3](http://i3wm.org/).

##Why I switched to i3

i3 is a very light-weight tiling window manager. Since quite some time I had started feeling all the  panels, the system menus, the starters, the status applets, desktop background, drag-drop functionality, border decoration and animations which Desktop environments provide to be useless. These functionalities consumed a lot of resources and slowed down my system. Moreover, more the functionalities, more are the bugs. I could do away with all those functionalities. I just needed a Window Manager. [This](http://adereth.github.io/blog/2013/10/02/why-you-should-try-a-tiling-window-manager/) blog post on using a tiling wm also motivated me.

Tiling Window manager can increase your efficiency by providing a lot of keyboard shortcuts. They make you less dependent on mouse. It is hard to get used to at first but you get used to it eventually.

They are heavily customizable. To start with, you can provide your own keyboard shortcuts but essentially you can make your own environment using all the apis and addons available for the window manager. 


There are many tiling wm available out there like [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), [notion](http://notion.sourceforge.net/) but I chose i3 because of its popularity and because some of my friends use it.

Following is a breif tutorial on things I found necessary to learn being a newbie to tiling wm.

##Installing i3
For ubuntu,

{% highlight bash %}
echo "deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ $(lsb_release -c -s) universe" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install sur5r-keyring
apt-get update
apt-get install i3
{% endhighlight %}

##Getting Used to i3

A good place to start is [i3 User's Guide](http://build.i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html). But it contains a lot of information which can be overwhelming at times.

When you first start i3, it asks if you want to use the default config(default config file is located in `/etc/i3`) or create a new config in `~/.i3`. I chose new config and it created a new config file. To edit the default config, this file needs to be updated. Then it asks for a mod key giving Alt key and Window key options. I preferred Alt Key. 

###Some Indispensable Shortcuts

* Alt + Enter - open Terminal
* Alt + D - menu to open applications(it lists only those apps which are in your path)
* Alt + Shift + Q - Close a window
* Ctrl + W - Close a window which has a cross on the top right to close it(generally browser tabs)
* Alt + 2 - a new workspace(use any number instead of 2)
* Alt + Shift + 2 - move the focused window to second workspace
* Alt + Shift + C - reload config file

These are default shortcuts and can be changed by updating the config file.

###Tabbed Layout
By default when you open a new window, the current window splits either horizontally or vertically to accommodate the new one. I prefer tabbed layout to horizontal/vertical or stacked layout. Use `Alt + W` to switch to tabbed layout.

###Volume Control
There is no volume control panel by default in i3. You can bind your own shortcuts to volume control. Modify your config to include the following

{% highlight bash %}
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- '-5%'
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- '+5%'
{% endhighlight %}

Here the XF86AudioLowerVolume and XF86AudioRaiseVolume are the multimedia keys on your keyboard for volume control. `bindsym` is used to bind a key to a command. `exec /usr/bin/pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- '-5%'` is to execute the `pactl` command on keypress. `pactl` command is for controlling a running pulseaudio server. So, above command only works when you have pulseaudio installed which is default in ubuntu.

*To reload the config file after making changes, use Alt + Shift + C*

###Screen Lock and Suspend

{% highlight bash %}
bindsym Control+Mod1+l exec i3-msg workspace 1 && i3lock -c 111111 -d
bindsym Control+Mod1+s exec sudo /home/shivanshu/.i3/suspend
{% endhighlight %}

Here suspend is a script which executes `pm-suspend` command. Since this command requires root permissions, and I needed to run it without password for i3 config, I added no password entry - `shivanshu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/shivanshu/.i3/suspend` at the end of the sudoers file (run `sudo visudo` to open the sudoers file).

You can find my config file [here](https://gist.github.com/shivanshuag/8614576). I will keep on updating the changes I make to my config.
I hope that i3 proves to be that perfect desktop environment I have been searching for although I think I can customize it to do whatever I want :D
