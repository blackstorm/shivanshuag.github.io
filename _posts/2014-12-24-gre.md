Linux has some absurd tools like fortune and cowsay. Fortune is a simple utility which displays random fortune cookies every time the user opens the terminal. Cowsay puts the message you give to it as an argument in a speech bubble with an ASCII image of a cow. You can combine cowsay and fortune to display a fortune cookie in the speech bubble of a cow. Nothing useful if you take them at face-value.

I have been repeatedly failing in my attempts to study English for GRE. I had tried Magoosh GRE flashcard, Barron's Gre Book but kept forgetting the words. I decided to display words instead of fortune cookies in my terminal. I use my computer profusely so this might help.

First problem was to get a list of words. Someone has uploaded all the words from Magoosh GRE flashcard and Barron's GRE on quizlet.com [here](http://quizlet.com/45492734/magoosh-gre-flashcards-basic-common-advanced-all-1000-flash-cards/) and [here](http://quizlet.com/8997815/barrons-800-essential-words-for-the-gre-flash-cards/). Now it was just a matter of scraping them and a simple python script was apt for the task. I scraped all the words and their meanings in a text file named `words`, each word separated by a '%'. This '%' has a special significance. It is useful in creating a random access file for strings which is used by the fortune program.
{% highlight bash %}
strfile words
{% endhighlight %}

This generates a `words.dat` file. I moved both - the `words.dat` file and the `words` file to the folder that contains the fortune database which in my case is `/usr/share/fortune`. Now fortune also uses this file for selecting cookies. But I just want the words and not any other cookie. In `fortune`, you can specify the name of the database from which you want it to randomly select a string. So, `fortune words` did the task.

While exploring fortune, I also found that you can specify the probabilities with which it selects string from each database. This is helpful beacuse I want to to select words from Magoosh Basic and Magoosh Common list more frequently than Magoosh Advanced. For this, I need the words in separate files according to category. No probelm because I found the different lists on quizlet.com [here](http://quizlet.com/45473963/magoosh-gre-flashcards-basic-all-i-vii-flash-cards/), [here](http://quizlet.com/45473977/magoosh-gre-flashcards-common-all-i-vi-flash-cards/) and [here](http://quizlet.com/45473953/magoosh-gre-flashcards-advanced-all-i-vii-flash-cards/), scraped them into different files and followed the same procedure. The script used for scraping and the list of words is available in a github repository [here](https://github.com/shivanshuag/cowsay-gre). So now my command is

{% highlight bash %}
fortune fortune 40% magoosh_basic 40% magoosh_common magoosh_adv
{% endhighlight %}
This gives a word from Basic and Common list with a probability of 0.4 and from Advanced list with a probability of 0.2.

To make it more interesting, I piped the output to cowsay. In cowsay, you can specify different ASCII images as argument. There is a default set of images in the `/usr/share/cows` folder.
{% highlight bash %}
fortune -c 40% magoosh_basic 40% magoosh_common magoosh_adv | cowthink -f $(find /usr/share/cows -type f | shuf -n 1)
{% endhighlight %}
This command selects a random ASCII image from the set of images in `usr/share/cows` folder for the cowsay application. I added this to my `.zshrc` file. And the results were interesting!
