I am Shivanshu, a senior UG student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I have the super awesome hobby of reading novels. Other things that interest me are movies and programming/hacking and Computer Science in general. I have recently taken to contributing to open-source and was selected in GSoC 2014 under Drupal. Recently, I started working on some stuff to contribute to OpenVPN. You may also know me as the ex-coordinator of Programming Club IIT Kanpur or the person whose site has a weird name or the guy with offbeat blue glasses.
