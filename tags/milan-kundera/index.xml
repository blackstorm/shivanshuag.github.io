&lt;p&gt;Existentialism is at the heart of the book, the book philosophizes in small doses in the between the narratives. While on one hand the burden of life feels cumbersome, realizing that one&amp;rsquo;s deicisions and actions are meaningless due to the fact that life is ephemeral can make that burden disappear. But is this lightness desirable given that it makes everything one does futile? Confronted with this contradiction, one is unable to decide which one to choose - lightness or weight. Infact since there is no rehersal for life, one cannot know what to want, there is no basis for comparision. These dualities are explored through the lives of characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters constantly brood over the unrealized possiblities of the actions they did not take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the themes that struck me was that about Kitsch. [something about conformism]
-&amp;gt; The part about Kitsch&lt;/p&gt;
