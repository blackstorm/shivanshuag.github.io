"Ghantagahr, Ghantagahr, Ghantagahr .... " cried an auto-rickshaw driver amidst the usual din of a busy crossroad at GT Road in Kanpur. I had been standing there in scorching may afternoon heat for about half an hour. A diverse group of people stood at the side of the road with me waiting anxiously. The unusual scarcity of autos going towards Ghantaghar at the time had made the crowd edgy. I ran towards the auto with my bag dangling from one hand and the other signaling the auto to stop. A dozen other people ran along with me. But the auto had only one empty seat and the people ahead of me were in a group of twos and threes. I silently praised my luck and got inside.

As I entered the auto, the first thing that my eyes fell on were the sunglasses. Sitting nicely upon her dimpled cheeks, the sunglasses perfectly complemented her impeccable white skin. I have never liked sunglasses. They simply take the color out of everything, make everything around you look so bland. But there was something enticing about that girl and her sunglasses.

People inside shifted to give me the window seat to keep my bag out of their way. When I settled inside the auto, I assessed my surroundings. Next to me sat a shabbily dressed man of about 60, wearing an untucked red chequered shirt and black trousers which were a bit too short for him. His shoes, once black, were covered in mud in a way that black showed only at a few irregular places. They were worn out from his innumerable adventures.

Next to this man sat a middle aged woman. She was hunched over and gossiping with another woman of about same age sitting opposite to her. From some of the words I could catch over the noise of the rickshaw, they were discussing about some or the other daily soap

The heat and humidity was made worse by all the dust coming in through the window next to me. I was drenched in sweat with the effort of catching the auto. I took out my handkerchief and started wiping the sweat off my face. Suddenly, I was conscious of her eyes on me. I looked up. She sat right in front of me. God she was pretty! Her head was turned in my direction for a moment and then she looked away. She in an animated with someone discussion over the phone. She was wearing a red kurti, which noticeably flaunted her curves, and jeans. She had the habit of biting her lower lip from time to time which made her even more sexy.

The glasses left for much to be imagined. One could only comprehend the beauty of the eyes belonging to such a beautiful countenance. Now, I have rarely talked to girls, that too very awkwardly. I 


As this was going in my mind, the auto jumped upwards, her phone flew out of her hand. As it was about to land on the floor, in a moment of chivalry and quick reflexes, I caught it.
