"Ghantagahr, Ghantagahr, Ghantagahr .... " cried an auto-rickshaw wala amidst the usual din of a busy crossroad at GT Road in Kanpur. I had been standing there in scorching may afternoon heat for about half an hour. A diverse range of people stood at the side of the road with me waiting anxiously. The unusual scarcity of autos going towards Ghantaghar at the time had made the crowd edgy. I ran towards the auto with my bag dangling from one hand and the other signaling the auto to stop. A dozen other people ran along with me. But the auto had only one empty seat and the people ahead of me were in a group of twos and threes. I silently praised my luck and got inside.

The heat and humidity was made worse by all the dust coming in through the window next to me. I was drenched in sweat with the effort of catching the auto. I took out my handkerchief and started wiping the sweat off my face. Suddenly, I was conscious of her eyes on me. I looked up. She sat right in front of me. God she was pretty! Her head was turned in my direction for a moment and then she looked away. She in an animated with someone discussion over the phone. She was wearing a red kurti, which noticeably flaunted her curves, and jeans. She had the habit of biting her lower lip from time to time which made her even more sexy.

The glasses left for much to be imagined. One could only comprehend the beauty of the eyes belonging to such a beautiful countenance. Now, I have rarely talked to girls, that too very awkwardly. I 


As this was going in my mind, the auto jumped upwards, her phone flew out of her hand. As it was about to land on the floor, in a moment of chivalry and quick reflexes, I caught it.
