The Fall of 2013 brought unprecedented challanges. It was the internship semester. It always take some time for things to register with me. Same was the case with the fact that I will have to sit for internship that semester. It is tough to figure out when it really happened. Was it when after a long and unproductive summer at college I was looking forward to do something interesting, something different. Or was it when I saw one of my batchmate to buying formal clothes. Or was it when one insipid afternoon I checked my inbox and found a mail for ppt of Walmart galring at me. Whatever it was, sometimes during the first two weeks of August, I realised that internship season was coming. It hit me that I will have to give an interview. I will have to sit in front of a total stranger, answer his questions, brag about myself, while my every activity will be judged by him. It was surely not a fascinating prospect. But then, it is a widely accepted fact that everyone should do an internship in the third year. And besides, I was eager to prove myself. Companies also pay you for internship. So it was decided, I will try hard to get an internship in the best possible company for next summers.

There were a few fundamental problems with this plan. I had mostly forgotten all the algorithms that were taught in 2nd semester and which are asked by most of the companies in their interviews, I am not very good(or maybe I dont try hard enough) at producing algorithms to problems in a limited time. To put it simply and realistically, I was not good enough. But one can always try. So began campaign to cram solutions to common problems asked in the interviews. I started carrying the slides of last year's DS and Algorithm course and read them at all possible times. I even started hunting geeksforgeeks.com for most commonly asked questions in interviews.

The campaign did not last long. Soon, I was back to my normal slacker self. The desire to be better at creating clever algorithms than others had passed away as easily as it had come. At that pont of time, I would have been satisfied with internship in any company. Meanwhile, the ppts and the tests started. First it was Walmart's ppt, then facebook's test, then Microsoft, then Goldman Sachs, then DirectI and so on. I got selected in none of them. I can distinctly remember the burst of activity in the wing just before a ppt with people going to borrow formal clothing and reminding some ignorant souls about the event.

Facebook's test came and went and unsurprisingly, I was not selected even though I kenw all the questions beforehand. My first surprise was Mirosoft. Let me describe the whole scenario. One day, we got a mail for Microsoft's ppt and you know what, it was the same day. I did not even come to know about it till someone told me at about 4 o'clock that Microsoft's ppt started at 5. I hurried to borrow formals from my friends and went there. It was terribly boring except the last part when they announced the list of shortlisted students. First came MSR Redmond where only the top 5 got shortlisted. Then it was time for MS IDC Hyderabad shortlist. My heart rate increased. They announced all the names one by one and my name wasnt't there. I was
