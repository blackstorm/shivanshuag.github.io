&lt;p&gt;This book is supposed to be an murder mystery. But it is not gripping enough and you never get that atmosphere of suspense, you never feel that tension in the air mostly because the book wanders off from the main plot many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a murder mystery set in medieval Europe was something new for me. The attention to detail on the life and politics of the medieval Europe is stunning and expected given that the author is a researcher in medieval philosophy and literature. I enjoyed the character of William of Baskersville. His wit and rationality in the dark ages when religious fanaticism and blind faith was the order of the day was refreshing. Throughout the story, through his philosophizing, he raises some of the most important questions relating to theology and science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sentences and phrases in the book are in Latin for which no translation is given. Either the author expected his readers to know Latin, or he is just showing off his knowledge of a dead language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A World Undone: The Story of The Great War</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started with this book to satiate my curiosity about the World Wars, which was ignited after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August&#34;&gt;The Guns Of August&lt;/a&gt;. And I was not disappointed. This single volume history of the World War I provides detailed account of the great war along with all the relevant background details which are perfect for someone totally unfamiliar with the subject and reading about it for the first time. Even though this is a non-fiction, the experience of reading this is similar to reading an fiction because of highly dramatic events of the war, described in detail, unfolding one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading this book made me realize how big a calamity the World War I was and how utterly ignorant about its scope, its scale, the politics involved and finally, the outcome. In the world where everyone was convinced that any war would be a short and quick affair lasting for not more than a few months, this war lasted for four years due to technology and scale of operation made possible by the industrial revolution. A lot of people died in warfare, the newly invented machine guns playing a large role in the massacre of soldiers. The scope of this war can be gauged from the fact that over 17 million people died in it, out of which 11 million were soldiers. About 4% of the population of Germany died in the war which is 1 out of every 25 German citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;events-that-led-to-war&#34;&gt;Events That led to War&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war was fought between Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire on one side, together known as the Central Powers and the Great Britain, France and Russia on the other side, together known as the Entente. Other smaller nation joined the war as it progressed, but these were the major players. The events that led to the war was assassination of Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Serbian terrorists.Due to this, Austria-Hungary and its ally Germany declared war on Serbia. To protect Serbia, Russia declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. France, having signed a previous agreement with Russia to enter a war together against any other European nation, also joined the war. Britain declared war on Germany because it invaded a neutral country - Belgium on its way to France and it had guaranteed Belgium&amp;rsquo;s neutrality in a previous treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the assassination of Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was the excuse which sparked the war, the war was a result growing concern over power balance in Europe. Germany was wary of the alliance between France and Russia and the improving relations between France and Britain. France was nurturing a grudge against Germany for taking away the regions of Alsace and Lorraine in  the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. Britain&amp;rsquo;s interest was in preventing Germany from establishing a hegemony in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even days before the war, the leaders of the nations thought that a World War could be avoided, a compromise between Serbia and Austria-Hungary could be reached so no one took the situation very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-domination-of-germany&#34;&gt;The Domination of Germany&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of the war, Germany showed its military strength by taking on the British, French and Russia combined on multiple fronts with very little help from Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. War showed Austria-Hungary to be a weak and decaying Empire and at the end of it, Austria-Hungary broke apart. Germany was able to fight for 4 years before it was overwhelmed by the entry of USA into the war in 1918 and unable to continue. Contrary to the popular thinking before the war, none of the armies were able to achieve a major breakthrough, capable of ending the war, they were striving for. All the while people kept on dying in the war by using outdated military tactics against the new machine guns. The war also introduced chemical warfare where armies tried to use Chlorine and Phosgene on the opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;propaganda-during-the-war&#34;&gt;Propaganda during the War&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about the war was the propaganda fed to the general public of the warring nations. To gain the approval of the public so that nations can continue the war at the cost of deteriorating living conditions, each side tried to vilify the opponent and prove the justness in their own cause. This made it difficult to hold peace talks during the war (a compromise meant shying away from the just cause and losing face to the public) and end it without completely defeating the opponent. Also, the people on the losing side felt terribly wronged while the winning nations felt justified in demanding heavy penalty from the opponents which laid the foundation for the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result&#34;&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Entente Won, and through the treaty of Versailles imposed heavy financial reparations on Germany, put restrictions on the size of its army, took away some parts of its territories, broke the Ottoman Empire and divided it amongst themselves. Germany was a monarchy before war. During the last year of war, the Kaiser(king of Germany) Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate the throne. Austria-Hungary also broke apart. There was a revolution in Russia, the monarchy was abolished and the Tsar and Tsarina executed along with their children. In a power struggle that followed, Bolsheviks gained power and established the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend everyone even remotely interested in History to read the book. It is a wonderful experience and will help disabuse you of many preconceived notions about the world. And I am on to reading about the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I read Fiction</title>
      <link>http://www.ninjaducks.in/books/why-i-read-fiction</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 13:35:54 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ninjaducks.in/books/why-i-read-fiction</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading fiction since I was 10. By the age of 12, I was hooked so much into it that I read nothing but fiction. Now, reading has turned into a habit. I always read for about half and hour almost ever night before going to sleep, more if I have time and mostly it is fiction. Over the time, my parents have relentlessly nagged at me for reading fiction. What good possibly come out of my reading made up stories about made up people in sometimes made up places and most of the times completely unrelated time periods? Am I simply wasting my time by reading fiction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools encourage reading novels. I was fortunate enough to go to a school which had a huge library which was stacked with all sort of books in neatly arranged racks. All the teachers in my school encouraged reading. Once, the librarian even forced us to read a novel of their choice. She gave it to us as a homework and we were supposed to tell her the brief story of our novel the next week. She went as far as to punish those who did not read it. Why would anyone make such a fuss about reading if it serves no purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course reading increases vocabulary and command at a language and many a times increase our knowledge, makes you more creative. But for me these are just side-effects. Reading conforms to other things. I read many a times for escapism, sometimes for the simple pleasure of reading, sometimes for nostalgia. Whether I am reading about the poverty of Francie Nolan in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn or the affairs of the rich in early 19th century England in Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice, it is to escape the real world with all its worries and people and root for the fictional characters. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6984795.Non_Pratt&#34;&gt;Non Pratt&lt;/a&gt; so eloquently writes in her article for The Guardian on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jun/10/adults-reading-ya-kids-teen-fiction-non-pratt&#34;&gt;adult&amp;rsquo;s reading children&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, reading is an end in itself&amp;hellip;. I read because my soul sings when I&amp;rsquo;m lost in a good narrative or caught up with characters I wish were real. I read because I love reading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many times at the end of the day I pick up and read an old novel like Harry Potter or Tom Sawyer just to reminiscence the old days when I read them originally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though these things are enough to motivate me to read, reading fiction also has a much deeper effect. According to Neil Gaiman in his lecture for The Reading Agency, reading builds empathy, by forcing us to imagine the situation from the words we read which is different than watching a TV or film. Empathy makes us broad minded, allows us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals. I recommend everyone to watch his lecture on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNIUWv9_ZH0&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNIUWv9_ZH0&lt;/a&gt; or read its summary on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming&#34;&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming&lt;/a&gt;. It makes you feel good about reading fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a culture like mine where there is scarcity of everything, and everybody is bent upon, as Aravind Adiga puts it in The White Tiger, breaking out of the rooster coop, most people don&amp;rsquo;t give much value to reading just for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a quote by George R.R. Martin to encourage all the readers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I like &#39;The Book Thief&#39;</title>
      <link>http://www.ninjaducks.in/books/why-i-like-the-book-thief</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 13:35:54 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ninjaducks.in/books/why-i-like-the-book-thief</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had read The Book Thief book in November and have been trying to write a review ever since but I could never finds words enough to describe it. It was the greatest reading experience I have ever had. Set in the Nazi Germany and narrated by Death(the Grim Reaper), it is the story of the life of a young girl Liesel Meminger - the book thief. The book deftly highlights the themes of destruction and loss of life in war, the viciousness of the Nazi propaganda and the power of words.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;pull-right&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1390053681l/19063.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A few chapters into the book, the narrator declares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It’s the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only the book does not have suspense but it derides it by telling the events in advance. Even though I love the thrill of not knowing something in advance, in this particular instance, it was this characteristic of the novel which made it special. The revelations about the future of the story help the reader to think about the event, relate it to all that is currently happening, and have a greater impact when it actually occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book never needs suspense to build upon. It has such deep characters, such rich descriptions, such an involving story and such a powerful narration that it never during the 500 pages does it loose its charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author markedly highlights the Holocaust through Max - a Jew, on the run from the authorities, who is covertly sheltered by Liesel&amp;rsquo;s family, and the countless crimes committed by the Nazi party against the Jews. But above all, the narrator Death has the most memorable impact on me with his keen observations and admiration for humans. Death in the book in many ways seems more living than dead. Death can feel joy, disappointment and can get depressed. A few of my favorite lines by Death are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race - that rarely do I even simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am haunted by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read it. You may or may not like it but it is definitely worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
